# BNF_per_year
A data repository for the Data BNF collection of "editions" (originally in RDF) published before 1900.

Most of the data has been moved to a year-based csv files, small enough to be technically opened in most spreadsheets app.

Each zip file contains all the csv files belonging to the period: if you uncompress data_bnf_1880_1890.zip you'll get a directory with 1880.csv, 1881.csv, 1882.csv, 1883.csv, 1884.csv, 1885.csv, 1886.csv, 1887.csv, 1888.csv and 1889.csv.
